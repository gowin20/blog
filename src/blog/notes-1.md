I have a lot of post-it notes with art on them. I'm talking *a lot* a lot; around 1500 in total. My eventual goal is to create a dynamic website allowing you to view and zoom in on high-quality photographs of each note. To realize my vision, I'm going to need to take a ton of pictures.

I want each post-it note to have its own high-resolution image that properly showcases its glory. In order to do this, I'll have to figure out an efficient way to digitize them in bulk. I did some googling and found this great [article on bulk photo scanning](https://www.scancafe.com/how-to/bulk-scan-photo-collection) from ScanCafe where they discuss several different methods.

There are several convient professional-grade options that are out of my reach. I could [pay a service to scan my photos](https://www.scancafe.com/services/photo-scanning), but I'm not willing to drop over $700 to digitize my collection. I could purchase a [bulk photo scanning system](https://www.amazon.com/Epson-FastFoto-FF-680W-Wireless-High-Speed/dp/B07DLX26BB/), but the price once again clocks in at a minimum of around $600. Ideally I'd like to do this for free, or spend no more than $100 trying.

It seems like my options are thus: Purchase an [affordable flatbed photo scanner](https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/) or devise my own ad-hoc method. Of course, I tried the more difficult and creative method first.

I spent some serious brainpower devising a good system to photograph these notes. I talked to my friends, and together we discussed different setups with accompanying diagrams. 

The core idea was to take a photo of each note, or a set of notes in bulk, using a suspended camera and proper lighting. I have a phone with a 64MP camera, which is more than enough power for what I need. For my first attempt, I quickly purchased a [ring light](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097SS6K9M?psc=1) and [phone mount](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072KNBV21?psc=1) to mount on my microphone arm. Let's see how this worked.

The lighting looks great, and the arm works well enough for my purposes. I set the notes on a black background that's anchored to the table, in order to keep each photo exactly the same. However, there's one serious problem with this setup: bent notes.

Not all of my specimens have been treated properly, resulting in many warped edges and bent notes. I need a way to flatten each note to a uniform size. When i first devised this method, my plan was to layer a sheet of plastic over the notes. That worked... not so well!

you can see the light source clear as day! You can even see my silly little face as well. This won't do at all. 

This problem is getting complicated and extemely janky. I should probably just buy a scanner.

This reflection problem turned out to be a much bigger issue than I thought, and I tried several different methods to fix it. I talked to my friend Armin, and he sent me these genius schematics that use suction to flatten the notes:

...i should probably just buy a scanner.
