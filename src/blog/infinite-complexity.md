I'm absolutely fascinated by this single, absolutely overwhelming thought: The true nature of reality is fundamentally beyond our ability to understand. 

We tend to forget this due to the age we live in. The modern era has brought forth a vast array of knowledge, declawing previously confounding phenomena like disease or the northern lights with concepts such as microscopic germs and the ozone layer. Right now, it feels like we will eventually be able to understand everything there is to know about life. However, we must consider that this may not ever be the case.

The nature of reality is a subject that is difficult to discuss. To do so here, I'd like to draw upon math: a subject full of unexplainable theories, infinite complexity, and fractal repetition.

Math also has constants such as the [Feigenbaum constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feigenbaum_constants) that define fundamental aspects of our reality. The Feigenbaum constants define ratios in a bifurcation diagram, and they influence everything from the population of rabbits to the water dripping out of your kitchen sink.

The values of these constants seems completely arbitrary. They just *exist*, yet we have no idea why they exist or why they take their values. Forget Feigenbaum, what about Pi? Euler's constant? The golden ratio? Of course, there are mathematical ways to calculate these values, but why do these constants have these specific values?

Our system of mathematics is something that humans have constructed after observing the nature of reality. It's our attempt to describe what reality looks like, but we need to go deeper in order to examine the "why".

Constants such as Pi and the Figenbaum constants, our "fundamental laws of the universe," could be the result of higher-dimensional manipulations that we have no ability to precieve.

Like a three-dimensional person bending a piece of paper. The two-dimensional stick figure can observe the properties of the bent paper, but has no idea that they are the result of a higher-dimensional being shaping the nature of its reality.

What if our existence in space-time could get bent like that piece of paper? And when the bending occurred, the value of pi changes from 3.14 to 2.14?

My personal belief is that higher-dimensional bendings in this way are where our "laws of reality" originate.

Even if there's not a higher-dimensional *life-form* bending our reality, it's still getting bent on its own by the environment itself.

A paper will get wrinkled, crinkled, and bent just by existing, not necessarily by humans. It could get blown by the wind, fall off a table, or affected by any other number of forces. It stands to reason that if higher dimensions of reality exist, forces must exist within those realities as well.

Of course I need to study more mathematics before saying anything authoritative on this. This is just my speculation. But it's scary to think that there's no real way to disprove it. Perhaps the meaning behind the value of our constants is another [logic edge](https://sites.google.com/site/logicedges/home), requiring a new branch of mathematics to investigate.


### logic edges

Humans have evolved to parse confusing situations into usable information. Everything about ourselves, from our vision to our relationship status to our system of math, is designed to provide clear-cut discrete values that are possible to understand.

But that's not what reality is like at all. Reality is a fuzzy, complicated mess where binaries like black and white do not exist. The true nature of reality is continuous and confusing and potentially beyond our comprehension.

The website [Logicedges](https://sites.google.com/site/logicedges/home) points out the limits in our current systems of understanding. 


the universe is truly so much more complex than we could ever fathom. Recent studies point to unsettling results: that the nature of reality is itself partially determined by our conception of it. If we believe something will happen, that makes it more likely to happen.

Quantum physics proves the veracity of manifestation

Religions since absolutely ages ago have been proponents of prayer. perhaps this is why.

We see the limits of our comprehension when we examine any complex system constructed by humans. Systems of logic are fundamentally limited. Check out Logic edges for great examples of this

That's why
