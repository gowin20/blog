description: appreciating the repeating chaotic patterns that escape our comprehension

the universe is truly so much more complex than we could ever fathom. Recent studies point to unsettling results: that the nature of reality is itself partially determined by our conception of it. If we believe something will happen, that makes it more likely to happen.

Quantum physics proves the veracity of manifestation

Religions since absolutely ages ago have been proponents of prayer. perhaps this is why.

We see the limits of our comprehension when we examine any complex system constructed by humans. Systems of logic are fundamentally limited. Check out Logic edges for great examples of this

That's why I'm absolutely fascinated by this single, absolutely overwhelming thought: The true nature of reality is fundamentally beyond our ability to understand. Even around us in space right now there could be factors completely unobservable that change and influnece everything about life. That has been true for millions of years and is no less true now, even now with our understanding of previously unobservable things like microscopic germs. There's so much more, on a smaller and smaller scale. On a larger scale too. All of these things are beautifully related to each other! And no single human being possesses the power to understand it all.
