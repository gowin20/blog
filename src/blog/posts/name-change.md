If you're reading this, you might know me by a different name.

My name is Gwen. If you previously referred to me using another name, please only call me Gwen from now on.

Why, Gwen?

Honestly, because I want to. It feels right, and it's something I get to choose for myself.

Gwen fits me better. My grandfather was named George, and he was a great man. A powerful one; he founded a company and sired 10 children. Lowkey so Muskcoded lol. 

There's also a long history of powerful men named George. A history that I've always felt forced to take part in. Leave my mark on the world. Change it somehow. Influence the people and structures around me. Make things better.

I still want to make things better. That's the driving force behind all that I do; I'm just trying to do it without being a man.

I don't want to be a man. I don't want to perform a traditional masculine role. I want to be free to express myself in the way that feels natural to me, which might be a lot different than what you think.

Sometimes I still do feel very masculine. But not usually.

I choose to present masc in public a lot because it's easier for me. I'm taller than most women and feel like I'll always get called "sir" no matter what I do.

My ass just isn't fat enough tbh we gotta pump that up

When I'm alone i want to be comfortable and express very feminine.

When I'm seen and known I want to be Gwen, a powerful enby.

I want to be a xenomorphgirl
