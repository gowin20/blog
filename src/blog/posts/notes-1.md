I have a lot of post-it notes with art on them. I'm talking *a lot* a lot; around 1500 in total. My eventual goal is to create a dynamic website allowing you to view and zoom in on high-quality photographs of each note. To realize my vision, I'm going to need to take a ton of pictures.

I want each post-it note to have its own high-resolution image that properly showcases its glory. In order to do this, I'll have to figure out an efficient way to digitize them in bulk. I did some googling and found this great [article on bulk photo scanning](https://www.scancafe.com/how-to/bulk-scan-photo-collection) from ScanCafe where they discuss several different methods.

There are several convient professional-grade options that are out of my reach. I could [pay a service to scan my photos](https://www.scancafe.com/services/photo-scanning), but I'm not willing to drop over $700 to digitize my collection. I could purchase a [bulk photo scanning system](https://www.amazon.com/Epson-FastFoto-FF-680W-Wireless-High-Speed/dp/B07DLX26BB/), but the price once again clocks in at a minimum of around $600. Ideally I'd like to do this for free, or spend no more than $100 trying.

It seems like my options are thus: Purchase an [affordable flatbed photo scanner](https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/) or devise my own ad-hoc method. Of course, I tried the more difficult and creative method first.

I spent some serious brainpower devising a good system to photograph these notes. I talked to my friends, and together we discussed different setups with accompanying diagrams. 

The core idea was to take a photo of each note, or a set of notes in bulk, using a suspended camera and proper lighting. I have a phone with a 64MP camera, which is more than enough power for what I need. For my first attempt, I quickly purchased a [ring light](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097SS6K9M?psc=1) and [phone mount](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072KNBV21?psc=1) to mount on my microphone arm. Let's see how this worked.

The lighting looks great, and the arm works well enough for my purposes. I set the notes on a black background that's anchored to the table, in order to keep each photo exactly the same. However, there's one serious problem with this setup: bent notes.

Not all of my specimens have been treated properly, resulting in many warped edges and bent notes. I need a way to flatten each note to a uniform size. When i first devised this method, my plan was to layer a sheet of plastic over the notes. That turned out to not be an option due to the harsh reflection on the plastic. My friend suggested using a vacuum to flatten the notes, in the following fashion:

{% image "./src/images/notes-1/notes-1-suction.jpg", "suction design" %}

{% image "./src/images/notes-1/notes-1-suction-design-.jpg", "suction setup" %}

{% image "./src/images/notes-1/notes-1-suction-design-2.jpg", "more suction setup" %}

This honestly seems smart. I'm going to try it out.
