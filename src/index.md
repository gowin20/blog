### About me

Hi! My name is Gwen Owen. I'm a programmer, author, and artist passionate about reality.

This website is currently undergoing a rework to add *âœ¨actual personalityâœ¨* rather than just being a gray blob. Stay tuned for delicious neon synthwave vibes ðŸŒ‡

At any given point you may happen upon me doing the following:
* developing web apps
* writing technical documentation
* drawing on post-it notes
* creating maps
* cultivating virtual community
* doing my nails and makeup
* supporting queer artists
