# About me

Hi! I'm George Owen, otherwise known as Gwen. I'm a creative person passionate about improving the world. I strive for excellence and grace in everything I do.

I'm currently employed with Esri building [technical documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/) for ArcGIS products. I'm the author of the ArcGIS "Security and authentication" guide, as well as the primary architect of most ArcGIS x open-source JavaScript integrations.

Outside of work, I enjoy:

* Designing websites and apps
* Solving tough technical problems
* Organizing collaborations and group events
* Playing board games, video games, and RPGs
* Hiking and being in nature
